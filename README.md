# Foxbrowser

The purpose of the project is to provide a full Firefox Sync powered replacement for Mobile Safari on the iPad. 
The backend code is forked from Firefox Home for iOS, on top of that I created an entirely new UI.

- Safari style UI (Might change in future releases)
- Support for Firefox Sync as in Firefox Home (Open tabs, Bookmarks & History)
- Secure end to end encrypted transport of your Sync data
- Up to 8 Tab's
- Start screen with the most frequent visited History entry's
- See open tabs from your other Firefox Sync enabled devices
- Real-time search in your browsing history, bookmarks and tabs
- Send Tweet's and mail's directly from the App
- Best of all: It's free

### Limitations
The Firefox Home codebase doesn't allow changes to the sync data yet, currently the browser works read-only.
If you visit a site that's not already in the history, it's added locally.
